# Read Me First
This is a small application to take item prices from a list and calculate to share the subtotal, total, tax, and sometimes add discount to the items in the list. Often times the total with include items that aren't taxable so those items will calculated differently. 

Basic structure of the project... 
- POJO class to hold the list items 
- ShoppingCalculate class that will pull in the list and run through it calucte the price 
- ShoppingCalculate class will handle the total of the prices based on the subtotal, tax, taxable and discount with the method getGrandTotal
- ShoppingAppliation class will be the main class to send the data to the future UI 

Future TODO 
- Have a React UI in docker to show the list of items 
- Possibly a button to click to show total with non taxable items vs taxed items
